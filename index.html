            <div class="about-me-text">
                <p>Hi there! I am a full stack developer based in the DC metro area. My previous experience was 
                    in the biomedical research field, until I decided to take my chances to make it as a developer.</p>

                <p>Five months later and hundreds of hours of coding at a software engineering intensive, I can 
                    call myself a developer. My creativity and curiosity have carried me to where I am, and I intend
                    to use them as my tools to keep building and developing awesome applications and websites!</p>
                    
                <p>Coding is just part of who I am, but there are many other pieces that make me whole. I am a 
                    dog mom, an avid cook and a novice in photography.  I aim high but dissect those big goals
                    into smaller pieces, so I donâ€™t miss anything. I have a sweet tooth and eat ice cream even 
                    if its below freezing outside.</p>
                
                <p>If you have any projects or ideas, I would love to hear about them and potentially become a collaborator.</p>
