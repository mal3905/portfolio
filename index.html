            <div class="about-me-text">
                <p>Hi there! I am a full stack developer based in the DC metro area. My previous experience was 
                    in the biomedical research field, until I decided to take my chances to make it as a developer.</p>

                <p>Five months later and hundreds of hours of coding at a software engineering intensive, I can 
                    call myself a developer. My creativity and curiosity have carried me to where I am, and I intend
                    to use them as my tools to keep building and developing awesome applications and websites!</p>
                    
                <p>Coding is just part of who I am, but there are many other pieces that make me whole. I am a 
                    dog mom, an avid cook and a novice in photography.  I aim high but dissect those big goals
                    into smaller pieces, so I donâ€™t miss anything. I have a sweet tooth and eat ice cream even 
                    if its below freezing outside.</p>
                
                <p>If you have any projects or ideas, I would love to hear about them and potentially become a collaborator.</p>

                DeerBear is a functional user friendly application for avid beer drinkers and
                aren't afraid to try new beers!Once the user has started to build their list of
                beers, the app will provide the user with a detailed dashboard of the generated
                list of beers. The user can find beer in beer list by sorting, filtering, and 
                searching for keywords. The dashboard also contains a feature that user can use
                to customize and create different list view i.e list, tile, or expanded view.
                It also provides the user with a visual map of exactly where they have tasted all 
                the hoppy goodness. User can search for local bars or breweries within a specified 
                radius from their zip code.
