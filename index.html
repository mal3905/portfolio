            <div class="about-me-text">
                <p>I was introduced into the world of coding through my former career as a biomedical researcher. 
                    My job involved creating thousands of data points each week and trying to analyze them in 
                    spreadsheets was not cutting it for me. This made me dig more into the world of coding and I got hooked!
                </p>

                <p>My passion for creativity made me realize that a career as a web
                    developer was the right path for me, which would allow my creative side to keep developing. I 
                    took a leap of faith and joined Thinkful, an engineer immersive bootcamp that has allowed me 
                    to expand my knowledge and skills in software engineering. I am eager to start my career working 
                    with a team of engineers and start solving problems in the world. 
                </p>
                
                <p>I also have other passions such as photography, cooking for my family,  and 
                    disk golf has become a regular sport for me.
